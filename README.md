# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on the detection and classification of brain tumours using deep learning techniques. Specifically, it leverages the EfficientNetB0 architecture to build a robust image classification model capable of identifying different types of brain tumours from MRI images.
